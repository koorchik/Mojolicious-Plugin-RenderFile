=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::RenderFile> is a L<Mojolicious> plugin that adds "render_file" helper. It does not read file in memory and just streaming it to a client.

=head1 HELPERS

=head2 C<render_file>

    $self->render_file(filepath => '/tmp/files/file.pdf', 'filename' => 'report.pdf' );

With this helper you can easily provide files for download. By default "Content-Type" header is "application/x-download" and "content_disposition" option value is "attachment".
Therefore, a browser will ask where to save file. You can provide "format" option to change "Content-Type" header.


=head3 Supported Options:

=over

=item C<filepath>

Path on the filesystem to the file. You must always pass "filepath" or "data" option

=item C<data>

Binary content which will be transfered to browser. You must always pass "filepath" or "data" option

=item C<filename> (optional)

Browser will use this name for saving the file

=item C<format> (optional)

The "Content-Type" header is based on the MIME type mapping of the "format" option value.  These mappings can be easily extended or changed with L<Mojolicious/"types">.

By default "Content-Type" header is "application/x-download"

You cannot pass both the "format" and the "content_type" option, as they are mutually exclusive.

=item C<content_type> (optional)

With this option, the "Content-Type" can be set directly.

By default "Content-Type" header is "application/x-download"

You cannot pass both the "format" and the "content_type" option, as they are mutually exclusive.

=item C<content_disposition> (optional)

Tells browser how to present the file.

"attachment" (default) - is for dowloading

"inline" - is for showing file inline

=item C<cleanup> (optional)

Indicates if the file should be deleted when rendering is complete

=back

This plugin respects HTTP Range headers.
